# NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024 Submission
## Makurdi Flood Prediction System

### Team
- **Lead Researcher**: Dr. Zedick Otokpa
- **Institution**: Federal University Otuoke, Nigeria

### Core Innovation
A Go-based flood prediction system that:
1. Models rainfall intensity using 50 years of historical data
2. Integrates real-time NASA GPM satellite data
3. Provides flood risk predictions through multiple interfaces:
   - REST API for integration with warning systems
   - Web dashboard for visualization
   - CLI tool for field engineers

### Technical Highlights
- **Statistical Modeling**: Gumbel distribution (RÂ²=0.9836)
- **NASA Integration**: Real-time satellite data ingestion
- **Deployment**: Containerized with Docker for reliability
- **Accessibility**: Web dashboard for non-technical users

### Impact Potential
- Protect 600,000+ residents in flood-prone Makurdi
- Reduce annual flood damage by 30-40%
- Scalable model for all of West Africa
